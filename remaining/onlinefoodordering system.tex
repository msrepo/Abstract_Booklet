The project ``Online Food Ordering System" is web-based system. With this Application, we are able to see the different restaurants in the Map. It also shows the location of the restaurants in the map. Customer can see the menu of different restaurant with their price. Only that customer/organization who is registered in the system can order the food from the restaurant. Restaurant will receive the ordered item and name of the customer when the order is taken by the customer. This type of application will be very useful if we have less time. This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and WAMP Server for its development.
