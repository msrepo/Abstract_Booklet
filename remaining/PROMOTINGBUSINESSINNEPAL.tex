``Promoting Business in Nepal" is designed specificially to help organizations to promote their marketing process. Till now there are many methods of marketing typical traditional marketing research uses tactics such as surveys, via techinques like mailing questionnaires to customers and conducting focus groups. Facing rapid social, technological, and economic change, the traditional marketing research industry will either adopt new tools and talent, repositioning itself in a more strategic, consultative space, or it will fall into decline. So to handle such tasks data analysis technique is being used these days. We use data analysis technique to promote marketing in big organization. Data analysis technique is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling raw data into a processed data which will support in decision making. We develop a web based application. Though our application is not quite useful to individuals but in case of big organizations, they may find it very useful.
