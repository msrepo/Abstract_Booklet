Till now there are many methods of marketing typical traditional marketing research uses tatics such as survyes, via techinques like mailing quesrionnaires to customers and conductiong focus groups. Facing rapid social, technological, and economic change, the traditional marketing research industry will either adopt new tools and talent, repositioning istelf in a more strategic, consultative space, or it will fall into decline. So to handle such tasks data analysis technique is being used these days. We use data analysis technique to promote marketing in big orgamization. Data analysis technique is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling raw data into a processed data which will support in decision making.
