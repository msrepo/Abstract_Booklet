``Opinion Mining Through Social Media" is a software system which facilitates its users to get the opinion on any matter of interest. This system rates the queried keyword so as to distinguish it as a good or a bad one. The input to the system is the word or group of words from the users. The system then extracts all the words from social media like twitter. All the collected words are lemmatized in order to singularize all the extracted words and then kept in the bag of words. The words are then compared with a trained library to give the sentimental analysis of the words. Each word is given a certain value as rating which is the output of the system This process of semantic analysis can be proved to be highly beneficial since it will help a lot in making a proper decision on any product or about a person. Decisive works will be much easier and faster as this system will solve the problem of information overloading, spamming and product monitoring.
