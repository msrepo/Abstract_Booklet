This ``SMS Application" project is about receiving SMS via PC from mobile, extract requested message, search the keyword on database, retrieve key-information and send the description to the mobile client from PC. The basic hardware components for system establishment are PC, data cable, at least two mobile cells with its phone-line connection services. A server PC interfaced with one mobile set via data-cable handles SMS message from any mobile client. Presently, different private companies are trying to implement this technology in their services and they are used to buy those applications from foreign which had seen to be more expensive. Moreover, the introduction of SMS Application has boosted the life style of people. It undeniably is the smartest information basket existing. Without it, we would have to rely on other expensive means to gather information. But now, with the help of this, we can find every single piece of information very easily.
