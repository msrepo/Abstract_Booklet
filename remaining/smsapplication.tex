The basic hardware components for system establishment are PC, data cable, at least two mobile cells with its phone-line connection services. A server PC interfaced with one mobile set via data-cable handles SMS message from any mobile client.

Moreover, the introduction of SMS Application has boosted the life style of people. It  is undeniably the smartest information basket existing.
