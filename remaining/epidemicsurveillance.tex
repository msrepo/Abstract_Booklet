Rapid response to a health epidemic is critical to reduce loss of life. Existing methods mostly rely on expensive surveys of hospitals across the country, typically with lag times of one to two weeks for influenza reporting and even longer for less common diseases. Here we devised a method for disease surveillance that uses microblogging site Twitter.com. In this project, we studied a particular problem: how to extract influenza outbreak information from Twitter. We devised a method by integrating 'Naive Bayes' with the 'bag-of-words' scheme to overcome the problem. This project helps to find the outbreak of the epidemic occurrence during its early phase.
