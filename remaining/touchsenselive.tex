This research work intends to develop such an application that could enable users to type on any applications on foreground using a simple paper. Touch Sense Live Paper Keyboard is a system that generates the keystrokes directly from a plain paper with characters drawn in it. The effect of keystrokes is seen on the application in focus. This system takes the help of camera in order to capture position of finger and keyboard (layout). OCR is used to  recognize letters in the paper and touch is sensed by the TouchSensor component. At the articulation point of these three components, system will send a corresponding key to foreground application.
