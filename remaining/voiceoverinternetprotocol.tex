Voice over Internet Protocol is technology that makes it possible to make a phone call using an Internet connection or a dedicated network  that uses the IP protocol,
rather than go through the normal telephone line.VoIP offers cheaper call prices with less quality of service than Public Switch Telephone Network(PSTN). VoIP is the use of Internet Protocol(IP), for real-time voice traffic. We explored various business and technical aspects for real time voice communication using VoIP instead of PSTN. Various type of protocols and codes used for voice transmission over Internet Protocol are explained. We focus on using VoIP on LAN/Intranet and have used User Datagram Protocol which focuses on performance rather than security and data integrity. This project can be easily used in any organizations using LAN to communicate within an organization without using Internet connection.
