The aim of these project ``Linux Magistrate" was to develop an administrative tool for Linux Server with user friendly web-based GUI. The aim was to develop tools to monitor the services of Linus Server as per the requirements of users and environment of system in the organization like offices, colleges and so on. The basic services like system information, disks information, managing user accounts, process monitoring, and so on, are supposed to be included in our project. Besides, other services include the advanced features like DNS configuration, DHCP configuration, Internet Usage Monitoring, Internet Access Control, configuring firewall and so on.

Linux Magistrate provides an easy way to monitor the activities in the Linux Server remotely that is very useful for the Linux System Administrators. The elegant web-based GUI interface helps to perform the administrative tasks with more ease compared to that of use of terminal.

The system starts with the welcome page prompting the user to establish his aunthentication. Then the user is guided to the administrative page where monitoring, controlling and editing of the services is done.
