``SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE" is a web based application that is aimed to facilate farmers, distributors, researchers, policy-makers and several other parties concerned to Agriculture in decision making. This application is chiefly targeted to help those who produce crops (i.e. farmers or farmer's groups ) in a way that they can analyze themselves suitable crop to grow in future using graphs of Demand and Supply. The distributors or the dealer's party can also take advantage from this application in finding what crop is produced in which region or location. An authorised dealer can book any item shown in the Google Map as per his need through this application. The project maintains the details of demand and supply of agro-goods and creates the visualizatiojn of data that support decision process. This application uses PHP, Html, CSS, AJAX, WAMP Server and JSON. The application analyzes data available or provided by farmers' groups and shows analysis graphs that are user friendly so that they can create plans for future and support both the parties (i.e. farmers' groups and dealers) in conducting deals with ease.
