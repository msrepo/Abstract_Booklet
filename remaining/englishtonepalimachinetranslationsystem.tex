English to Nepali Machine Translation System is a translator that converts English sentences into corresponding Nepali sentences. The system is domain specific (children story translation). The Machine translation system consists of Morphological Analyzer, Part of Speech Tagger, Nepali Mapper, Nepali Generator, Dictionary and Transfer rules. The English Morphological Analyzer identifies root word and its type according to appropriate part of speech. Based on the root word, the word is mapped to corresponding Nepali word which is in Romanized form. Then, after applying transfer rules following Nepali Grammar, the corresponding Nepali sentence is generated.

The English Morphological Analyzer Tagging are done with Freeling, an opensource tool. The output of Freeling is input to Nepali Generator. It contains several transfer rules following Nepali Grammar rules. Lastly, the engine produces Romanized Nepali sentence. The engine can be run from command line or simple user interface can be created to use the engine.
