The project explores the possibility of choosing the options in the game - Tux Racer. Options here mean choosing course, choosing a playable character throughout the game. Tux Racer is a 3D computer game starring the Linux mascot, Tux the penguin. In the game, the player controls Tux as he slides down a course of snow and ice collecting herring. This game is growing its popularity as it has interactive interface, easay to play and understand, fun for all people who prefer peaceful sporting challenges rather than bloody alien massacres. Unlike many other computer games, there are no options for choosing the playable character.

This is an exploration project. The game is based on opensource development model. The benefit of using opensource is that the cods can be redistributed or modified under the terms of GNU ( General Public License). The organization of codes are in modular fashion. So, here we present a roadmap to adding a new Tux. On the course, we added a new course named as ``RIK" in the game.
