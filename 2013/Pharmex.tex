“Pharmex” is an Android-based application that primarily lets users buy pharmaceutical products using their smartphone devices. This application is useful to people of all ages. It uses Android SDK, Java Programming Language and MySQL server for the remote database as the major tool for application development. The major outcome of this application is that users don’t have to wander for a product. Instead, they can open the app and search the product they want and contact the owner and so on. This saves a lot of time and as we know, time management is a must in this today’s leading world. Thus this application comes in handy.

The core objective is to make the relation between the seller and the consumer of pharmaceutical products more formal.
