 As you all know that our project is a web-based application which can be done by online for selling, buying. From our survey, people were betrayed by the agent. Agents are also made for earning money by doing good or bad work but many of the agents betrayed their customer by showing other’s land, a possibility of firing by taking money of customer and becoming contactless. So for this type of problem, we created this project for the help of people. It means dealing with goods and services through the electronic medium and internet. Our project is also like e-commerce sites doing electronically which makes easier in buying, selling and advertising. It facilitates a new type of information based business processes for reaching and interacting with the customer like online advertising and marketing, online order taking and online customer service.
