It is obvious for students to search the course materials online for the purpose of study. It is heavily tedious and boring job to go through each and every topic of the syllabus to search the respective content and it is not even worth spending so much time for searching the contents. If there are so many students depending on the internet for searching the course materials then it would be a better solution to provide a platform where teachers do such searching and share the materials in the platform for the students to be easily available under the topic of each syllabi. Doing so makes it time saving and the abundance of materials allows us to choose from the variety a best content. The reusability of same content through sharing makes the process of searching for contents lesser. The procedure of up voting the content encourages the sharer while the learners can have information about the best content for the specific topic.
