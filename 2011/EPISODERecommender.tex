These days there are too many contents being produced for the TV audience stream-able online as well as airing on the TV. It is really difficult to choose from a myriad of options given the limited leisure time available to the viewer. ``Episode" Recommender is designed with the sole intention of helping such TV content consumer to find a suitable match for their taste. Our application recommends users to watch certain shows based on the user's interests and behavior. A sample survey was used for reference to determine the viewing behavior, its implications and suitable recommendation algorithm for the application. Episode recommender application fills the void that the TV audience have long felt due to choice paralysis that occurs due to heavy production of TV content. It helps the audience select best TV shows to watch and at the same time provide objective assessment of the time they spend watching TV shows.
