 Beauty sections of departmental stores are filled with a variety of products of various brands that promises a lot of beauty enhancements. People looking for suitable product to use often get intimidated by the number of choices they have. In order to help in that scenario, the beauty product recommendation system recommends products based on user's beauty profile and preferences. It also takes into account the preference of users with similar beauty profile. The recommendation system is currently limited to Moisturizers.
