The purpose of our project was to build an online, real-time, multiplayer tag game. First we searched on app stores for two different types of games:online multiplayer games and tag games. We found that most popular tag games had multiplayer feature but not across the network(online). On the other hand,there were tons of other online multiplayer games with more advanced features. So we decided to merge these two things in our own way. Then our next aim was to find the appropriate platform to build our game and our search ended with the result ``Unity 3D, a popular game development platform". As the next important thing in our project was ``across the network(online)", so we began searching on the internet about how we can  implement networking on Unity 3D in an efficient way. We came across many different solutions and among them we chose ``Photon Engine, a multiplayer game networking engine". In a nutshell,``Chase Me" is a tag game that can be played at real-time with multiple players across the internet which is built using Unity 3D.
