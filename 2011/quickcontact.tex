The aim of our project is to develop a web and mobile phone application prototype for connecting household service seekers and providers using Android. The web interface is used only for searching the contact details. The service providers must belong to a company or they themselves can be a company for getting registered to the web application. The mobile application is to be installed on the mobile phone.

The original idea came from the yellow pages. There are many yellow pages concept web and mobile applications but they are targeted for worldwide which is almost useless to general people in Nepal. Those systems are complex and need to go through the documentation before using them correctly. So, we have built a telephone book application in which the telephone numbers and often advertisements of business enterprises are listed in numerous sections, organized by the category of the business, with a  classified telephone directory.
