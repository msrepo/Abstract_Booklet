A person may not know the date of written exams or trials to acquire driving license. He/She can fill up the form online by viewing the information that will be provided. The criteria of the forms that will be accepted is also not certain. Even online payment is not possible. So our project, “Driving License Management” not only provides information about transportation and driving license but also solves the problem of manual filling up of the form. Driving License Management can be helpful for managing the way of acquiring license. It may be systematic and effective for users.
