\chapter[Foreword From The  Principal]{Foreword}

It gives me great pleasure to introduce this Abstract Booklet, a synopsis of the culmination of work by Bachelor of Software Engineering students' thesis of Gandaki College of Engineering and Science(GCES) Batch 2001-2013.

With the rise of open access concept in academic circle, this is our humble contribution in disseminating what has stayed within our library premises. Rather than sit in shelves, I think the ideas/theses that has been encapsulated in this booklet will act as a point of extension for upcoming students looking to work on top of what has already been done. This inherent spirit of openness in the academic circle, I hope, will benefit all concerned institutions \& individuals.

Summing up, I hope that this booklet is also a start of possibility in more openness, interaction, tie-ups and symbiosis among institutions \& students which I am sure enriches the academic community.
